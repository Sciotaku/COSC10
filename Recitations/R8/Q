Implement a single-threaded dictionary server that will serve requests
to define and to lookup meanings of words, and a dictionary client
that gets words from the console (one at a time) and asks the server
for their definitions.


Take the basic HelloClient and HelloServer, and modify them so that
there are meaningful messages back and forth. For example,
a “GET word” request to look up a word in a dictionary, and a
 “SET word meaning...” request to define that word in the dictionary.
The server holds a map. Don’t bother to synchronize access to the map
 for the drill, but consider the potential pitfalls when going to
multi-threaded.
